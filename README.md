# Credit Risk Analysis

**Project type:** Notebook-based credit risk analysis and modeling.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on credit risk analysis using Python, combining data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain insights into patterns that influence loan approval and risk classification. It leverages pandas for efficient data manipulation and matplotlib for clear, data-driven visualizations.

The workflow includes:

Importing and cleaning raw credit risk data from Excel.

Performing descriptive statistics and detecting missing or inconsistent values.

Visualizing key financial and demographic variables related to creditworthiness.

Identifying correlations and risk factors that help evaluate borrower reliability.

This repository provides a structured, reproducible notebook suitable for data analytics, financial modeling, and credit scoring insights using open-source Python tools.

## Methodology (summary)

The notebook performs exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering (as present in the code), model training using one or more supervised classifiers, and evaluation using standard metrics and validation techniques (as present in the code).
